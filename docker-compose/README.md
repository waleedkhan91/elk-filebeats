# ELK stack POC for nginx logs using filebeat.

This is a complete Demo POC for ELK stack implementation using filebeats using docker-compose.

User can modify this demonstration as per their needs. Basic flow of this deployment is the running instance of nginx server which generates access and error logs. We will process these logs into the ELK stack using filebeats.

For this implementation, I have used following commands.

<commands will be updated here shortly...>

After successfull installation verify the flow by generating get requests to nginx and then check the logs in kibana. You manually have to add index pattern in kibana before the logs are appeared.

Feel free to drop me an email if you have any questions.

Cheers !!!
